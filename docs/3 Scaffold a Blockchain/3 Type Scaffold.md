# Type Scaffold Reference

The `starport type` command scaffolds files that implement create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) functionality for a custom new type.

```
starport type [typeName] [field1] [field2] ... [flags]
```

**typeName** string

  The name of a new type. Must be unique within a module.

**field1**, **field2**, and so on

  Fields of the type. Define fields with a compact notation colon (:) syntax. For example, for an  `amount` field that accepts an integer, use: `amount:int32`. Supported types: `string`, `bool`, `int32`. By default, fields are `string`.

A type is scaffolded in a module. 

**--module** 

  The name of the custom module in which a type is scaffolded. By default, a type is scaffolded in a module name that matches the project name. 

The following files and directories are created and modified by scaffolding:

* `proto`: services for SDK messages and queries, HTTP endpoints
* `x/module_name/keeper`: gRPC message server and query handler
* `x/module_name/types`: message types, keys
* `x/module_name/client/cli`: CRUD actions on the CLI
* `x/module_name/client/rest`: legacy HTTP endpoints
* `vue/src/views`: Vue component, a CRUD form for interacting with the type

CLI commands are created for CRUD interactions with the type. 

For example, if the binary is named `appd`, the module is `blog`, and the type is `post`, then the following transaction commands become available:

```
appd tx blog create-post [title] [content]
appd tx blog delete-post [id]
appd tx blog update-post [id] [title] [content]
```

Commands for querying:

```
appd q blog list-post
appd q blog show-post [id]
```

## Example

```
starport type post title body comments:bool count:int32 --module blog
```

This command creates a `post` type with four fields: `title` and `body` strings, boolean `comments`  and integer `count`. This type is created in a module called blog.
